// NOTE: Technical language generally uses the term _octet_ to describe a group
// of 8-bits. This is because the term _bytes_ is not actually well defined.
// There is no reason that a byte must be 8 bits. A byte is the smallest
// addressable unit in a system, which historically and practically has been
// designated 8 bits. There is not reason that a byte couldn't be 16, 32, 5,
// 19, or any other number of bits. However, in the implementation of this
// module, it will be assumed that octects and bytes are equivalent and
// interchangeable.

// NOTE: In the specification of the Internet protocols (RFCs), the terminalogy
// is a bit confusing. The RFCs use big-endian format, but the bit labelling is
// different than usual. The RFCs label the MSB as 0, whereas typically the LSB
// is 0. The code uses the format where the LSBs are 0, but the comments which
// reference RFCs use the MSB as 0 to be consistent with them.

/// According to RFC 791, an IP header has the following format
///
///  0                   1                   2                   3

/// This module implements a transmitter for an Ethernet port. This is used to
/// send variable sized UDP packets using IPv4.
///
/// Since UDP is inherently unsafe (there are plenty of reasons a packet can
/// get dropped), a portion of each packet's payload is (optionally) used as a
/// counter by setting the [USE_COUNTER] parameter on the module. This causes
/// the first 4 bytes of the packet to contain an integer giving the packet a
/// sequence number. Out of order packets can then be received and
/// reconstructed, and dropped packets can be detected. When the [USE_COUNTER]
/// is disabled, the first 4 bytes of the packet are instead used as part of
/// the data, allowing 4 more bytes to be transmitted.
///
/// The [DATA_WIDTH] parameter describes the maximum width (in bytes) that the
/// module should be prepared to transmit through the [data] port. Here is a
/// summary of the most important information sourced from RFCs.
///
/// *   RFC 768: a UDP header is 8 bytes.
/// *   RFC 791: the maximum sized internet header is 60 bytes.
/// *   RFC 791: every host must be able to receive a datagram of at least 576
///     bytes.
///
/// These specifications imply that the safest maximum size of a UDP payload is
/// 576 - 60 - 8 = 508 bytes. This means that the maximum data size that can
/// safely be transmitted is 508 is [USE_COUNTER] is disabled, and 504 if
/// [USE_COUNTER] is enabled.
///
/// The [size] signal is optional, but gives finer control over what is sent.
/// When the [send] signal rises, both [size] and [data] are latched. There are
/// two cases that can happen here.
///
/// 1.  When [size] = 0 or [size] > DATA_WIDTH, the entire [data] register is
///     sent.
/// 2.  When 0 < [size] <= [DATA_WIDTH], the lower [size] bytes in ther [data]
///     register are sent and the rest are ignored.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// *   [USE_COUNTER] indicates whether a counter should be embedded in the
///     packets to label their order. A value of 0 disables the counter and a
///     value of 1 enables it. All other values are invalid.
///     positive, that number of bytes is used for the counter.
/// *   [DATA_WIDTH] is the width in bytes to be transmitted in the payload of
///     each UDP packet.
/// *   [DIVIDER] is the value of a clock divider that is used to generate a
///     new clock from the system clock. The new clock is used to write to the
///     Ethernet PHY. The divider must be large enough so that the produced
///     clock is no faster than 25MHz (which is the max speed supported by the
///     10/100 PHY).
///
/// # Ports
///
/// *   [clk] is the system clock.
/// *   [reset] is the system reset signal.
/// *   [data] is the bus of data to be transmitted over the port.
/// *   [eth] contains the signals used to write to the Ethernet PHY.
/// *   [ip_info] is the source and destination data that is needed to transmit
///     the packet.
/// *   [send] is a rising edge active signal that starts sending the [data].
/// *   [size] is an unsigned number that indicates the number of bytes of
/// *   [data] to be sent in the current packet. Set this to 0 to always send
///     the entire [data] register.
/// *   [ready] indicates that the module is ready to accept a [send] signal to
///     transmit more data. This is held high while ready and falls when the
/// *   [send] signal rises.
